Why Women in STEM?
Women are underrepresented in STEM fields, and this lack of diversity is a problem for both the industry and society as a whole. Women bring unique perspectives and experiences to the field, and it is important to have a diverse workforce to solve complex problems and drive innovation. However, women face many barriers to entry and advancement in STEM fields, including bias, lack of support and mentorship, and societal expectations.
